# My Portafolio

> My portfolio is a Vue.js project single web page, applying basic concepts such as routing, components and adding a [BULMA](https://bulma.io/) CSS framework

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```


## Vue.Js and Bulma works great together for better user experience
